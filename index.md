## Featured Projects

### Phishing Website Detection (Capstone Project)
Completed as part of my Data Science Capstone at Boston University.  
Built a machine learning model to classify phishing URLs using 11,055 samples and 88 features.  
**XGBoost achieved an AUC of 0.99**, with strong accuracy and interpretability.  
This project demonstrates full end-to-end modeling: EDA, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, and business recommendations.

### Housing Value Prediction (Machine Learning Milestone Project)
A milestone project from my **Machine Learning course **.  
Predicted residential **assessed tax values** using regression models and feature engineering.  
Implemented Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, PCR, and PLSR.  
**PLSR outperformed PCR** with fewer components and better generalization, showing strong skills in supervised learning and regularization.

### Food-101 Image Classification (Advanced Machine Milestone Project)
A current milestone project in my **Advanced Machine Learning course**, focused on deep learning and computer vision.  
Trained convolutional neural networks and transfer-learning–based models on the Food-101 dataset.  
Compared frozen vs. unfrozen models, efficiency, regularization techniques, and model convergence.  
This work showcases experience with TensorFlow, GPU training, and large-scale image classification.
